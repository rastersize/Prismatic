# Prismatic - Chalmers printing app

:warning: **Application is not maintained. This is a code-dump for posterity.** :warning:

At the University of Technology Chalmers we had a printing system which allow you to print a document by uploading it to a site. This didn’t work very well with iOS devices, in fact it didn’t work at all.

While a student of Chalmers I started build an app to solve this problem and make it possible to print documents from ones iOS device. This app was never completed as I left the university shortly after starting to do my master’s thesis. As such I had no use for it anymore :smiley:
